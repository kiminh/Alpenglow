Data generators
---------------

The classes in this module are responsible for generating data subsets from the
past.  This is necessary for embedding offline models into the online
framework, that needs to be updated in a batch.  See
:py:class:`alpenglow.experiments.BatchFactorExperiment` for a usage example.
